# Synchronous I/O
- Caller sends a request and blocks.
- Caller cannot exeucute any code meanwhile.
- Receiver responds, Callers unblocks.
- Caller and Receiver are in "Sync".

## Example of an OS synchronous I/O
- Program asks OS to read form disk.
- Program main thread is taken off of the CPU.
- Read completes, program can resume execution.

# Asynchronous I/O
- Caller sends a request.
- Caller can work until it gets a response.
- Call either:
  - Checks if the response is ready (epoll).
  - Receiver calls back when it's done (io_uring).
- Caller and Receiver are not necessary in "Sync"

## Example of an OS asynchronous call (NodeJS)
- Program spins up a secondary thread.
- Secondary thread reads from disk, OS blocks it.
- Main program still running and executing code.
- Thread finishing reading and calls back main thread.

## Asynchronous workload is everywhere
- Asynchronous programming (promises/futures)
- Asynchronous backend processing.
- Asynchronous commit.
- Asynchronous IO in Linux (epoll, io_uring)
- Asynchronous replication.
- Asynchronous OS fsync (fs cache)
