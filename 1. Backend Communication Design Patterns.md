# Request Response
1. **Client** sends a **Request**.
  - In **TCP**, the data that the **Client** send is a continuous stream of data. Data may be serialized.
2. **Server** parses the **Request**
  - **Server** needs to parse the data to look for the start and end of a **Request**.
3. **Server** processes the **Request**
  - De-serialization may be needed.
4. **Server** sends a **Response**
5. **Client** parses the Response and consume.

## Where it is used?
- Web, HTTP, DNS, SSH
- RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
- SQL and Database Protocols
- APIs (REST/SOAP/GraphQL)

## Anatomy of a Request / Response
- A request structure is defined by both client and server. And they both have to agree on it based on the protocol being used.
- Request has a boundary and it is defined by a protocol and message format.


A GET HTTP Request structure.
```
GET HTTP/1.1
Headers
<CRLF>
BODY
```

For large requests, there are two options to send data.
- Send the entire large request (Simple)
- Send chunked requests (Efficient and resumable)

## Doesn't work everywhere
- Notification service
- Chatting application
- Very long-running request

# Synchronous vs Asynchronous workloads
## Synchronous I/O
- Caller sends a request and blocks.
- Caller cannot exeucute any code meanwhile.
- Receiver responds, Callers unblocks.
- Caller and Receiver are in "Sync".

### Example of an OS synchronous I/O
- Program asks OS to read form disk.
- Program main thread is taken off of the CPU.
- Read completes, program can resume execution.

## Asynchronous I/O
- Caller sends a request.
- Caller can work until it gets a response.
- Call either:
  - Checks if the response is ready (epoll).
  - Receiver calls back when it's done (io_uring).
- Caller and Receiver are not necessary in "Sync"

### Example of an OS asynchronous call (NodeJS)
- Program spins up a secondary thread.
- Secondary thread reads from disk, OS blocks it.
- Main program still running and executing code.
- Thread finishing reading and calls back main thread.

### Asynchronous workload is everywhere
- Asynchronous programming (promises/futures)
- Asynchronous backend processing.
- Asynchronous commit.
- Asynchronous IO in Linux (epoll, io_uring)
- Asynchronous replication.
- Asynchronous OS fsync (fs cache)
