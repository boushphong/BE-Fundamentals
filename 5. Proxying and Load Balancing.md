# Proxy
A Proxy is a server that makes requests on your behalf. 
- The client knows the destination server
- The destination server doesn't know the client
- The destination server knows the proxy server and vice versa

## Proxy use cases
- Caching
- Anonymity
- Logging
- Block Sites
- Microservices

# Reverse Proxy
- The client doesn't know the true destination server, the client only knows the reverse proxy server
- The client could talk to `google.com` but `google.com` might be a reverse proxy, which it will talk to the actual backend servers (Can be load-balanced)

**NOTE**: A load balancer is a reverse proxy, but not every reverse proxy is a load balancer
- A reverse proxy might be used for caching content, enforcing security policies, or routing requests based on certain criteria without necessarily distributing the load across multiple servers. Hence not every reverse proxy is a load balancer

## Reverse Proxy use cases
- Caching
- Load Balancing
- Ingress
- Canary Deployment
- Microservices
