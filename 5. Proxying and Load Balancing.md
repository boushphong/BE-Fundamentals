# Proxy
A Proxy is a server that makes requests on your behalf. 
- The client knows the destination server
- The destination server doesn't know the client
- The destination server knows the proxy server and vice versa

## Proxy use cases
- Caching
- Anonymity
- Logging
- Block Sites
- Microservices

# Reverse Proxy
- The client doesn't know the true destination server, the client only knows the reverse proxy server
- The client could talk to `google.com` but `google.com` might be a reverse proxy, which it will talk to the actual backend servers (Can be load-balanced)

**NOTE**: A load balancer is a reverse proxy, but not every reverse proxy is a load balancer
- A reverse proxy might be used for caching content, enforcing security policies, or routing requests based on certain criteria without necessarily distributing the load across multiple servers. Hence not every reverse proxy is a load balancer

## Reverse Proxy use cases
- Caching
- Load Balancing
- Ingress
- Canary Deployment
- Microservices

# Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancers
## Layer 4 Load Balancer
The client initiates a TCP connection with the load balancer. Upon receiving the request, the load balancer will forward it to the backend server. The load balancer will also initiate a TCP connection with the backend server. Ideally, the load balancer should forward requests from the same client to the same backend server if local session control is implemented.

## Layer 4 Load Balancer Pros and Cons
- **Pros:**
  - Simpler load balancing
  - Efficient (No data lookup)
  - More secure
  - Works with any protocol
  - One TCP connection (NAT)
- **Cons:**
  - No smart load balancing
  - Not recommended for microservices
  - Sticky per connection
  - No caching
  - Protocol unaware (can be dangerous)

## Layer 7 Load Balancer
L7 Load Balancer is similar to L4 Load Balancer. However, when it comes to L7 Load Balancer, the load balancing becomes protocol specific. Since L7 can peek at the request payload, it allows the LB to make routing decisions based on application-level information such as HTTP headers, URLs, and cookies. When a client initiates a connection with the load balancer, it inspects the content of the request, allowing it to intelligently distribute traffic based on factors like server load, geographic location, or specific application logic.

Upon receiving a request, the L7 load balancer can perform advanced functions such as content-based routing, SSL termination, session persistence, and application-level health checks. It then forwards the request to the appropriate backend server based on the configured routing rules.

One significant advantage of L7 load balancing is its ability to optimize performance and user experience by directing traffic to the most suitable backend server based on factors beyond just server availability and capacity. This level of granularity enables efficient load distribution and improves application scalability and reliability.

## Layer 7 Load Balancer Pros and Cons
- **Pros:**
  - Smart load balancing
  - Caching
  - Great for microservices
  - API Gateway logic
  - Authentication
- **Cons:**
  - Expensive (have to peek at the payload)
  - Decrypts (Terminates TLS)
  - Two TCP Connections
  - Must share TLS certificate
  - Needs to buffer
  - Needs to understand protocol
