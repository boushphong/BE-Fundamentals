# Process vs Thread
## What is a Process?
- A set of instructions
- Has an isolated memory
- Has a PID
- Scheduled in the CPU

## What is a Thread?
- Light weight Process (LWP)
- A set of instructions
- Shares memory with parent process
- Has an ID
- Scheduled in the CPU

## Single Threaded Process
- One Process with a single thread
- Simple

## Multi-processes
- App has multiple processes
- Each has its own Memory
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- More memory but isolated
- Redis backup routine (COW)
- Examples: NGINX, Postgres

## Multi-Threaded
- One Process, multiple threads
- Shared Memory (compete)
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- Require less memory
- Race conditions
- Locks and Latches (SQL Server)
- Examples: Apache, Envoy

## How many is too many?
- Too many processes/threads
- CPU context switch
- Multiple Cores help
- Rule of thum -> Number of Cores = Number of Processes

# How Connections are Established
## Connection Establishment
- TCP Three-way handshake
- SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK

- Server Listens on an address:port
- Client connects
- Kernel does the handshake creating a connection
- Backend process “Accepts” the connection

- Kernel creates a socket & two queues SYN and Accept
- Client sends a SYN
- Kernels adds to SYN queue, replies with SYN/ACK
- Client replies with ACK
- Kernel finish the connection
- Kernel removes SYN from SYN queue
- Kernel adds full connection to Accept queue
- Backend accepts a connection, removed from accept queue (Will be put in the application process)
- A file descriptor is created for the connection

The SYN queue and accept queue are both components of the TCP/IP stack in the kernel of an operating system, and they are closely related in the context of TCP connection establishment.

1. **SYN Queue**: When a client initiates a TCP connection by sending a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, the server's TCP/IP stack processes the incoming SYN packets and queue it in the SYN Queue. The SYN queue holds pending connection requests that have not yet been fully established or accepted by the server. Once the connection is fully established via three-way handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK and ACK). The connection request will be moved to the accept queue. The job of the kernel here is done.

2. **Accept Queue**: The accept queue, also known as the connection backlog or listen backlog, holds fully established connections that are waiting to be accepted by the server's application. Once the server's application calls the `accept()` system call, it removes a connection request from the accept queue and creates a new socket for communication with the client. The accept queue allows the server to handle multiple pending connections concurrently, even when the server's application is busy processing other tasks.

**During the TCP connection establishment process:**

When the server's TCP/IP stack receives a SYN packet and successfully establishes a connection, it sends a SYN-ACK packet back to the client to acknowledge the connection request and to signal readiness to establish a connection. At this point, the connection is considered half-open, and the server's TCP/IP stack holds information about the pending connection in memory.

Once the server's application calls the `accept()` system call to accept the connection, the half-open connection transitions to a fully established connection, and the server's TCP/IP stack creates a new socket for communication with the client. This fully established connection is then moved from the SYN queue to the accept queue, where it waits to be processed by the server's application.

## Problems with accepting connections
- Backend doesn't accept fast enough
- Clients who don't ACK
- Small backlog
  - The server's OS may not immediately accept the connection but instead queues it up in a backlog
  - The server has a limited capacity to queue up pending connections. 

# Reading and Sending Data
## Send and receive buffers
- Client sends data on a connection
- Kernel puts data in receive queue
- Kernel ACKs (may delay) and update window
- App calls read to copy data

## Receive buffers

## Problems with reading and sending
- Backend doesn’t read fast enough
- Receive queue is full
- Client slows down
