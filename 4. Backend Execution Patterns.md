# Process vs Thread
## What is a Process?
- A set of instructions
- Has an isolated memory
- Has a PID
- Scheduled in the CPU

## What is a Thread?
- Light weight Process (LWP)
- A set of instructions
- Shares memory with parent process
- Has an ID
- Scheduled in the CPU

## Single Threaded Process
- One Process with a single thread
- Simple

## Multi-processes
- App has multiple processes
- Each has its own Memory
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- More memory but isolated
- Redis backup routine (COW)
- Examples: NGINX, Postgres

## Multi-Threaded
- One Process, multiple threads
- Shared Memory (compete)
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- Require less memory
- Race conditions
- Locks and Latches (SQL Server)
- Examples: Apache, Envoy

# How many is too many?
- Too many processes/threads
- CPU context switch
- Multiple Cores help
- Rule of thum -> Number of Cores = Number of Processes
